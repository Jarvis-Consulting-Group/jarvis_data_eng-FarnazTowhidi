      "description": "I have developed \"Chatterbox,\" an instant messaging application with a Client-Server architecture that enables real-time communication between users. In this single-page application, the client-side scripting is implemented using React and Material-UI (MUI), providing a seamless and intuitive user interface. To handle data storage and manipulation, CRUD requests are sent to the server through API calls using Express.js and MongoDB. The application leverages Socket.io to achieve the functionality of instant messaging, enabling users to engage in real-time conversations. Additionally, the aws-sdk package is utilized to facilitate the smooth uploading of images to Amazon Web Service (AWS) S3 buckets. This allows users to easily share and display images within the application. Lastly, the project is deployed to Heroku, ensuring that Chatterbox is accessible and available to users on a reliable hosting platform.",

      "description": "I have developed an MVC application that allows users to create and delete tweets on Twitter using the Twitter REST API v2. The application follows a layered architecture with four components; Model, Controller, Service, and Data Access. The Controller layer handles client input and calls the service layer to handle the business logic. The service layer interacts with the Data Access Object for communication with the Twitter REST API. This enables actions such as posting, showing, and deleting tweets. To ensure the quality of the code, integration and unit testing are performed using the Mockito and JUnit4 libraries. To authenticate with the Twitter API, the application utilizes the OAuth 1.0a protocol, which includes the necessary credentials in the HTTP Authorization header. For easy distribution and deployment, the project is packaged into a Docker image and published on Docker Hub. In addition, the spring boot framework is used to manage dependencies.",

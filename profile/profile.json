      "description": "As an ethical researcher, in my PHD, I proposed a model to identifying the weaknesses of a cue-based graphical passwords to dictionary attack.   This model analyze an image and identifies areas within the image that have the potential to capture the user's attention. Since any high difference in colour, intensity and orientation can highlight the object from its surrounding, the algorithm calculated the values of these three features for all pixels in the image. The output consists of points that exhibit noticeable dissimilarities from their surroundings, indicating their likelihood to attract the user's focus.  These areas created a new dictionary of graphical password, that were used to attack actual passwords of users. The model used Matlab for color detection, HTML for user interface and SQL Server for databases of passwords.",

In this single-page application, the client-side scripting is implemented using React and Material-UI (MUI), providing a seamless and intuitive user interface. To handle data storage and manipulation, CRUD requests are sent to the server through API calls using Express.js and MongoDB. The application leverages Socket.io to achieve the functionality of instant messaging, enabling users to engage in real-time conversations. Additionally, the aws-sdk package is utilized to facilitate the smooth uploading of images to Amazon Web Service (AWS) S3 buckets. This allows users to easily share and display images within the application. Lastly, the project is deployed to Heroku, ensuring that Chatterbox is accessible and available to users on a reliable hosting platform.",

      "description": "I have developed an MVC application that allows users to create and delete tweets on Twitter using the Twitter REST API v2. The application follows a layered architecture with four components; model, controller, service, and data access. The Controller layer handles client input and calls the service layer to handle the business logic. The service layer interacts with the Data Access Object for communication with the Twitter REST API. This enables actions such as posting, showing, and deleting tweets. To ensure the quality of the code, integration and unit testing are performed using the Mockito and JUnit4 libraries. To authenticate with the Twitter API, the application utilizes the OAuth 1.0a protocol, which includes the necessary credentials in the HTTP Authorization header. For easy distribution and deployment, the project is packaged into a Docker image and published on Docker Hub. In addition, the spring boot framework is used to manage dependencies.",

My academic journey includes earning a master's and PhD in computer science from UTM University, where my research focused on demonstrating the vulnerability of graphical password authentication to dictionary attacks. Specifically, my research investigated the aggregation of regions within an image that exhibit low-level properties and their impact on security.  However, recognizing the importance of practical and technical skills in the software engineering industry, I decided to complement my academic expertise with hands-on experience. This led me to enroll in the General Assembly software immersive bootcamp, where I gained proficiency in a range of programming languages and frameworks, including Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Angular, Next.js, MongoDB, and Django. Additionally, I honed my skills in utilizing essential tools such as Git, Docker, and agile methodologies during the bootcamp."

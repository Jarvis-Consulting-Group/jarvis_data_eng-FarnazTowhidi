# Introduction
Implemented a trading app with MVC architecture using React frontend and Express backend. The React frontend, built as a single-page application, renders server-side HTML elements and communicates with the backend using Axios for HTTP requests. Users can view a list of traders and quotes, as well as add new traders via the user-friendly interface. The backend serves as an API, facilitating seamless interaction between the frontend and backend components. 


# Quick Start


```
npm install
npm start
```

# Test
Through coding the frontend and backend server should be up and runnig through:
```
React frontend: npm start
Express backend: Nodemon server
```
Manual testing validates whether the frontend app HTTP requests to the backend application. The manual tests also validate each input for the forms in the frontend application to ensure no invalid inputs are inserted and sent to the backend.

# Deployment
The application is deployed on a GitHub repository. To set up the frontend application, users are required to have Node and npm installed. They can clone the repository from GitHub and execute the commands "npm install" and "npm start" to install dependencies and run the application. For the backend server, the nodemon package is used, and it should be running using the command "nodemon server". These steps ensure the proper functioning of the application and allow users to interact with the frontend interface seamlessly.
